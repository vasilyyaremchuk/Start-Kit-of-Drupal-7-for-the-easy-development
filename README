This is drush make file with installation profile.

You are welcome to use it to get start with Drupal 7 more easy and comfortable.

I started my distribution on the base of Build Kit (http://drupal.org/project/buildkit).

Also I tried to use some solutions from Acquia Drupal Gardens (http://www.drupalgardens.com/)

See the updates on the project site http://drupal-distributions.org/
